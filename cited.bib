	abstract = {Abstract An important but difficult combinatorial problem, in general, is to find the optimal route for a single vehicle on a given network. This paper defines a problem type, called the General Routing Problem, and gives an algorithm for its solution. The classical Traveling Salesman Problem and the Chinese Postman Problem are shown to be special limiting cases of the General Routing Problem. The algorithm provides a unified approach to both node and arc oriented routing problems, and exploits special properties of most real transportation networks such as sparsity of the associated adjacency matrix, and the tendency for arc symmetry at many nodes. For node oriented routing problems, this approach tends to produce large reduction in effective problem size.},

On the other hand, capacitated arc routing problems have been comparatively neglected. Both classes of problems are extremely rich in theory and applications. Our intent in this paper is to define a capacitated arc routing problem, to provide mathematical programming formulations, to perform a computational complexity analysis, and to present an approximate solution strategy for this class of problems. In addition, we identify several related routing problems and develop tight lower bounds on the optimal solution.},

	ABSTRACT = {In the last ten years, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been applied in archaeology. The ArchAIDE project realised an AI-based application to recognise archaeological pottery. Pottery is of paramount importance for understanding archaeological contexts. However, recognition of ceramics is still a manual, time-consuming activity, reliant on analogue catalogues. The project developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on-site, for optimising and economising this process, while retaining key decision points necessary to create trusted results. One method relies on the shape of a potsherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the shape-based recognition, a novel deep-learning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer profile of a sherd. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the algorithms meant facing challenges related to real-world archaeological data: the scarcity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of different categories; and the need to take note of minute differentiating features. Finally, the creation of a desktop and mobile application that integrates the AI classifiers provides an easy-to-use interface for pottery classification and storing pottery data.},

	ABSTRACT = {Airborne LiDAR technology is widely used in archaeology and over the past decade has emerged as an accurate tool to describe anthropomorphic landforms. Archaeological features are traditionally emphasised on a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using multiple Visualisation Techniques (VTs), and occasionally aided by automated feature detection or classification techniques. Such an approach offers limited results when applied to heterogeneous structures (different sizes, morphologies), which is often the case for archaeological remains that have been altered throughout the ages. This study proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a multi-scale analysis of topographic position combined with supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). Rather than highlighting individual topographic anomalies, the multi-scalar approach allows archaeological features to be examined not only as individual objects, but within their broader spatial context. This innovative and straightforward method provides two levels of results: a composite image of topographic surface structure and a probability map of the presence of archaeological structures. The method was developed to detect and characterise megalithic funeral structures in the region of Carnac, the Bay of Quiberon, and the Gulf of Morbihan (France), which is currently considered for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a result, known archaeological sites have successfully been geo-referenced with a greater accuracy than before (even when located under dense vegetation) and a ground-check confirmed the identification of a previously unknown Neolithic burial mound in the commune of Carnac.},

	abstract = {The variation in the shape of cereal grains, namely; barley, oat, rye and wheat (Canada Western Amber Durum and Canada Western Red Spring), were quantitatively evaluated using principal components analysis (PCA) based on elliptic Fourier descriptors. Grain image boundary contours were extracted from the digital images of kernels, expressed as chain-coded points and then approximated by 13 elliptic Fourier coefficients. After normalization of the size, rotation and starting point of the contours, four groups of coefficients namely; invariant, symmetrical, asymmetric and standardized Fourier coefficients were analyzed separately using PCA. The PCA based on the symmetric Fourier coefficients captured the shape variability of different grains with fewer principal components (PCs) than the rest. Results suggest that the major shape variations of grains can be summarized by the first two, five, eight and seventeen PCs of the symmetric, standardized, invariant and asymmetric Fourier coefficients, respectively, capturing about 99% of shape variations. The effect of growing regions on kernel shapes was also studied and results revealed that the shape variability is well captured by the PCA of the symmetric coefficients of the standardized Fourier descriptors.}

Advantages of the procedure are that it does not require integration or the use of fast Fourier transform techniques, and that bounds on the accuracy of the image contour reconstruction are easy to specify. Elliptic properties of the Fourier coefficients are shown and used for a convenient and intuitively pleasing procedure of normalizing a Fourier contour representation. Extension of the contour representation to arbitrary objects at arbitrary aspect angle is discussed. The procedures have direct application to a variety of pattern recognition problems that involve analysis of well-defined image contours.}

	abstract = {The task of assembling fragments in a puzzle-like manner into a composite picture plays a significant role in the field of archaeology as it supports researchers in their attempt to reconstruct historic artifacts. In this article, we propose a method for matching and assembling pairs of ancient papyrus fragments containing mostly unknown scriptures.Papyrus paper is manufactured from papyrus plants and therefore portrays typical thread patterns resulting from the plant’s stems. The proposed algorithm is founded on the hypothesis that these thread patterns contain unique local attributes such that nearby fragments show similar patterns reflecting the continuations of the threads. We posit that these patterns can be exploited using image processing and machine learning techniques to identify matching fragments. The algorithm and system which we present support the quick and automated classification of matching pairs of papyrus fragments as well as the geometric alignment of the pairs against each other.The algorithm consists of a series of steps and is based on deep-learning and machine learning methods. The first step is to deconstruct the problem of matching fragments into a smaller problem of finding thread continuation matches in local edge areas (squares) between pairs of fragments. This phase is solved using a convolutional neural network ingesting raw images of the edge areas and producing local matching scores. The result of this stage yields very high recall but low precision. Thus, we utilize these scores in order to conclude about the matching of entire fragments pairs by establishing an elaborate voting mechanism. We enhance this voting with geometric alignment techniques from which we extract additional spatial information. Eventually, we feed all the data collected from these steps into a Random Forest classifier in order to produce a higher order classifier capable of predicting whether a pair of fragments is a match.Our algorithm was trained on a batch of fragments which was excavated from the Dead Sea caves and is dated circa the 1st century BCE. The algorithm shows excellent results on a validation set which is of a similar origin and conditions. We then tried to run the algorithm against a real-life set of fragments for which we have no prior knowledge or labeling of matches. This test batch is considered extremely challenging due to its poor condition and the small size of its fragments. Evidently, numerous researchers have tried seeking matches within this batch with very little success. Our algorithm performance on this batch was sub-optimal, returning a relatively large ratio of false positives. However, the algorithm was quite useful by eliminating 98\% of the possible matches thus reducing the amount of work needed for manual inspection. Indeed, experts that reviewed the results have identified some positive matches as potentially true and referred them for further investigation.},

	ABSTRACT = {Landscape archaeology has a long history of using predictive models to improve our knowledge of extant archaeological features around the world. Important advancements in spatial statistics, however, have been slow to enter archaeological predictive modeling. Point process models (PPMs), in particular, offer a powerful solution to explicitly model both first- and second-order properties of a point pattern. Here, we use PPMs to refine a recently developed remote sensing-based predictive algorithm applied to the archaeological record of Madagascar&rsquo;s southwestern coast. This initial remote sensing model resulted in an 80% true positive rate, rapidly expanding our understanding of the archaeological record of this region. Despite the model&rsquo;s success rate, it yielded a substantial number (~20%) of false positive results. In this paper, we develop a series of PPMs to improve the accuracy of this model in predicting the location of archaeological deposits in southwest Madagascar. We illustrate how PPMs, traditional ecological knowledge, remote sensing, and fieldwork can be used iteratively to improve the accuracy of predictive models and enhance interpretations of the archaeological record. We use an explicit behavioral ecology theoretical framework to formulate and test hypotheses utilizing spatial modeling methods. Our modeling process can be replicated by archaeologists around the world to assist in fieldwork logistics and planning.},
